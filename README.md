# Clockwork - OneGameAMonth - September 2013

## Overview
A hexagon-based puzzle game. Rotate the tiles to connect their sides with
adjacent tiles and form a path.

## Dependencies

* [jaws - Javascript graphics library](https://github.com/ippa/jaws)

I've included the library in the src directory so that this project contains
the correct version of it, in case later versions introduce breaking changes
(though as it hasn't been updated recently, this seems unlikely).
